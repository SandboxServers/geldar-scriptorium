# Repo instructions for every agent

These rules apply to Claude Code, Codex, Copilot and any other harness. Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) first: it holds the repo rules and commands, and they apply to every agent, not only Claude. Then read only what your task needs:

| Before you... | Read |
|---|---|
| design anything | the frozen spec in the geldar repo (`docs/spec.md`, the scope), its `docs/decisions/` (what is settled), and grep `.claude/agent-memory/` for the topic |
| work on the scriptorium campaign | [docs/analysis/scriptorium/RESUME.md](docs/analysis/scriptorium/RESUME.md), then its `README.md` ledger |
| implement a packet | your packet's section of [docs/analysis/scriptorium/work-packets.md](docs/analysis/scriptorium/work-packets.md) and [.claude/agents/packet-coder.md](.claude/agents/packet-coder.md) |
| review a packet or PR | [.claude/agents/packet-reviewer.md](.claude/agents/packet-reviewer.md) |
| open, update or merge a PR | [.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md) |

Harnesses without Claude Code's skills or subagents read those files directly: a skill's `SKILL.md` is the procedure, an agent's `.md` is the brief.

## Running a campaign

A campaign is a folder `docs/analysis/<campaign>/` holding a ledger (`README.md`), `work-packets.md` and `RESUME.md`. The full process is the [campaign-packet skill](.claude/skills/campaign-packet/SKILL.md). In short, the session that orchestrates:

1. Reads `RESUME.md` and the ledger before acting, and again after any compaction or resume.
2. Gives each packet its own git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` and one implementing agent.
3. Has every finished packet reviewed by a fresh, read-only reviewer that did not write it. A `fix` verdict goes to a fresh coder, up to 3 review passes.
4. Updates the ledger's packet rows and rewrites `RESUME.md` (40 lines at most) at every wave boundary.
5. Ships with the `ship-pr` skill and removes the worktree the same day.

Owner decisions are never guessed: the ledger marks them `BlockedDecision` and the orchestrator asks the owner.

## Writing for people

In PR bodies, issue comments and reports, reference files from the repo root (`docs/analysis/scriptorium/README.md`), never absolute host paths. Keep it short and lead with the outcome.
