name: campaign-packet
description: Run a multi-PR effort in geldar-scriptorium as a campaign of prescriptive work packets - the session writes or updates the ledger and packets, dispatches one packet-coder per packet in its own worktree, runs read-only packet-reviewer loops, and keeps RESUME.md current. Use when the user says "resume the scriptorium campaign", "run the next wave", "split this into packets", "dispatch workers", or when writing or reviewing a work-packets.md, RESUME.md, worknote or ledger.

# Campaign and work packets

Ported from Cimmeria's `campaign-packet`, trimmed for a small repo: there is no orchestrator-only persona, no `ops` agent, no agent board and no merge queue. The main session orchestrates and may use a shell. Add the heavier machinery if the campaign grows to many parallel agents.

| Step | Who | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger, packet slicing, decisions | main session (or a Plan agent for a hard slice) | `README.md`, `work-packets.md`, `RESUME.md` |
| Worktrees, PRs, merge, removal | main session, with the `ship-pr` skill | nothing in the campaign folder |
| One packet in one worktree | `packet-coder` | a local commit and a report |
| Review a packet, a wave or the campaign | fresh `packet-reviewer` (read-only) | a report with numbered fix notes |
| Apply fix notes | fresh `packet-coder` | a fix commit and a report |

## 0. Before acting

Read `docs/analysis/<campaign>/RESUME.md`, then the ledger `README.md`. Open a packet's section in `work-packets.md` only when you dispatch or review it. Check `git worktree list` and recent branches (`git log --all --since="1 hour ago" --oneline`) so you don't collide with another live session. Write the campaign name to `.claude/state/active-campaign` (gitignored).

## 1. The campaign folder

- `README.md` (the ledger): purpose and exit criteria, a **Decisions** table (`D-SC-NN`: status, owner, record link), and a packet table with status **Ready / BlockedDependency / BlockedDecision / Writing / Review / Done**.
- `work-packets.md`: dispatch rules, the shared **contract** packets build against (names, paths, schemas, return formats), then one section per packet grouped into waves.
- `RESUME.md`: at most 40 lines. Current wave, packets in flight with their worktrees, the next action, open decisions.
- `worknotes/`: leftovers from finished packets and ruling notes.

Owner decisions are never guessed. Mark them `BlockedDecision` and ask the owner (AskUserQuestion) before dispatching what depends on them. A settled decision gets a record in `docs/decisions/` and its ledger row links it.

## 2. Packets are prescriptive and self-contained

A packet-coder (Haiku) finishes a packet in about **40k working tokens**; anything bigger is split. The coder skips CLAUDE.md, so each packet **inlines** the rules it needs. Each packet names:

- the exact files to create or change, with code shapes for anything non-obvious and the spec sections it implements;
- the test to add and why it fails when the change is reverted;
- its checks in order (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, or `./scriptorium.ps1 check`);
- versions to pin, when it adds dependencies;
- the branch, worktree name and commit subject.

Waves hold about four to six packets that one reviewer can hold at once. A wave usually ships as one PR from an integration branch, or one PR per packet when they are independent.

## 3. Dispatch a wave

1. Create the wave's integration branch from `main` (`scriptorium/wave<N>`) and push it. Create one worktree per packet from that branch (`ship-pr` skill § 1, with `origin/scriptorium/wave<N>` as the start point). Merge each packet branch into the wave branch with `git merge --no-ff` once its review says `ship`; packets that build on another branch from the wave branch after that merge.
2. Dispatch every independent packet of the wave in one message, in the background. Each brief stays under about 25 lines: the worktree path; the packet section (file and heading, not its text); the report path `<worktree>/.claude/reports/<campaign>/<packet>-<role>.md` (role `coder`, `review-<N>`, `fix-<N>`); the commit message with attribution lines; and the one-line return `<packet> <done|blocked|failed> <commit-sha|-> <report-path>`.
3. On each return, update the ledger row. Open the report only on `blocked`, `failed` or a `decision` verdict.

Never keep an agent alive with messages or resume a finished one: follow-ups go to a fresh agent with the report as input.

## 4. Review loops, then ship

| Loop | When | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Packet | as soon as its coder returns `done` | the packet's commit range |
| Wave | when every packet of the wave has `ship` (waves of two or more) | the wave together: contract drift between packets, duplicated code, two packets editing one file |
| Campaign | after the last wave merges | everything the campaign merged: docs that no longer match, decisions with nothing behind them |

Each pass is a fresh `packet-reviewer`. `ship` ends the loop. `fix` on pass 1 or 2 goes to a fresh `packet-coder` ("review fix, pass N of 3", the report path; it applies only the `## Fix notes`), then a fresh reviewer for pass N+1. `fix` on pass 3, or `decision` on any pass, goes to a ruling: the main session (Opus) decides re-spec, re-slice, accept with a follow-up packet, or ask the owner, and writes it to `worknotes/<packet>.md`. Opus rules; it does not implement packets.

A coder that stops on context gets a fresh coder that continues from its report ("continuation N of 3"). After 3 sessions, re-slice the packet.

Then ship with the `ship-pr` skill and update the ledger rows.

## 5. State on disk

At every wave boundary rewrite `RESUME.md` and the ledger rows. The transcript is not the record: a compaction or a new session must be able to continue from the campaign folder alone.
